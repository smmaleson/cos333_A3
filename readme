Shayna:

I wrote on the registrarapp program, handling the logic of browser calls as well as the
information sent back and forth. Thus I worked on most of the Flask programming and feel very
comfortable with using Flask now. I also covered error handling and contributed significantly
to the html pages. ***** ADD *****

Ellen:
I contributed to the html pages, focusing on matching reference formatting and other details. I
also helped to debug and talk through the registrarapp program. Most of my time was spent
researching html, learning to use its different features and repeatedly testing our pages
to ensure perfect format.
